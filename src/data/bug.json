        "title": "Inside Microsoft's Massive Headquarters",
        "description": "Microsoft is one of the most influential and high-tech companies the world has ever seen. But have you ever wondered what it’s like to work there? Microsoft’s sprawling headquarters is no vanilla corporate office – instead, it’s more of a miniature city, with its own transit system, shopping mall, treehouses and even a grimy lake for dunking cocky senior executives. And that’s before we get into the secret underground tech labs where the very future of all our online lives is being developed. Or the hallway where high-fives are mandatory. \n\nSo join us today as we don our trusty lanyard and delve deep inside the Microsoft headquarters. \n\nCovering an area of just over 500 acres in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Headquarters is quite rightly known as a campus. And just like a university or college campus, it comprises dozens of buildings – over a hundred all told – as well as sports fields, woodland trails and secluded courtyards for taking well-earned breaks. \n\nInside Microsoft's Massive Headquarters",

        "description": "Right in the heart of silicon valley, Facebook is cooking up a big new project to expand its Menlo Park campus into what can only be described as a fully-fledged town.\n\nSince humble beginnings in Zuckerberg's Havard dorm room, Facebook HQ has passed through a number of short-lived locations. Rapid growth led to years of hopping from one office to another; however, the roots are only getting deeper in their current location – and it's not hard to see why.\n\n\nFacebook's campus sits in a not so little corner of Palo Alto, and the entirety of its construction has been built around the wellbeing of the people that make the company tick, the employees. \n\nStepping away from canning workers into grey cubicles like sardines, Facebook's HQ follows an open plan, natural light-filled, home away from home approach that encourages creativity, collaboration, and good vibes only.\n\nClose to the banks of San Francisco Bay, facebook's Menlo park or 'MPK' campus sprawls across hundreds of acres and is split into 3, soon to be 4 sections.",

Quantum computing and advanced prosthetics will rise. We will move around the world with Hyperloop technology, evtols, electric cars, self driving vehicles, and electric/supersonic airplanes. Our packages will be delivered by drones and our power will come from renewable energy. There will be a permanent base on the Moon, humans on Mars, and space hotels in orbit. While our food consumption transforms, vertical farming and biotechnology will rise. Stem cells and CRISPR technologies will regenerate injuries and cure diseases. Lastly, we will battle climate change by removing carbon directly from the atmosphere.

Apple chided Suyin, but maintained ties for months and even years afterwards. \n\nWith new allegations like this, and a spate of associated with the brand’s manufacturing base over the years, we thought it was time we put on our lanyards and take a peek inside an iPhone factory in China. \n\nInside An iPhone Factory in China",

        "description": "Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ◄\n\nIf the average full-time worker who makes $50k a year worked 40 hours a week for two million years, they’d still not be as rich as Jeff Bezos. \n\nThe sheer volume of money flowing into billionaire bank accounts is astronomical. But it’s not as simple as stashing wads of hundred-dollar-bills under the bed. The reality is that, unless these billionaires operate tactically, their wealth will sizzle as inflation grows over time. Rather than a swimming pool full of gold, the world’s richest diversify amongst stocks, trusts, real estate, business ventures, and, of course, a little over-the-top splurging now and then.  \nkeep your jealousy in check as we decipher how the financial elite hold, spend, and maximise their money.\n\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",

        "description": "Amazon is the world’s biggest retailer, and its CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s richest man, for one very good reason. His company is better than anyone else, ever, at giving people what they want, quickly. \n\nAmazon acquired its undisputed status as heavyweight champion of the retail universe thanks largely to its lightning-fast delivery times. The astonishing feat of ferrying hundreds of millions of items, from guitar strings to saucepans to car parts, directly to your door, inside 24 hours, is nothing short of a modern logistical miracle. \n\nSo how does Amazon do it? A super-smart army of slave robots, for one. Ingenious, if occasionally unscrupulous, management practices are part of the answer too. And the modern-day voodoo of deep-learning AI – all of which are made flesh in the most advanced stockrooms the world has ever seen. So join us today, as we button up our hi-vis jacket and journey inside Amazon’s smart warehouses.",

        "description": "What looks like a giant spaceship parked in the lush flats of Cupertino, California, is actually tech giant Apple's new HQ. Fittingly named the Apple Park, this stunning architecture sprawls across 176 acres of land and might just be one of the most stunning campuses in the world. \n  \nDespite its incredibly futuristic looks, the apple park has been a long time in the making, with Steve Jobs first announcing the project way back in 2006. \n\nIt took 8 long years of planning, proposals, and permit applications, but by 2014 construction was well underway – and by 2017, the vast apple workforce was already starting to move in. \n\nThe massive ring-shaped building is now an iconic symbol of the Apple brand and is a fantastic testament to the company's dedication to effortless design, sustainability, and the future of technology.",

        "description": "Eight million data centres around the world are processing our entire online lives thousands of times a second, but Microsoft may have just rewritten this growing industry, and it may be for the better.\n\nWith our reliance on cloud based services expected to be at an all time high in 2021 due to a huge shift online pushed forward by the ongoing pandemic, the need for the most energy and time efficient data centres is crucial moving forward. Microsoft has just reached the end of a two year stage two experiment, sinking our data to the ocean floor, and here’s why this is big news.\n\nOn 9 July 2020, the tech giant reeled up what it calls its ‘Northern Isles,’ a 12.2 metre long steel cylinder, from the seabed. The giant tube remained 117 feet below the surface for 2 whole years, gathering data which would later be analysed by engineers.\n\nThe company chose to locate this long term experiment 10 miles off the coast of Scotland in the Orkney Islands archipelago. Here, 100% of the energy comes from environmentally green sources such as wind and solar.\n\nWhy Microsoft Has Underwater Data Centers",

Well, kind of - you see, they're technically making so many different Amazon products and services for their customers, that they're intertwining themselves in to every aspect of your life! Even your sidewalks will have bluetooth soon! \n\n\nSubscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ◄\n\n25 years ago, Jeff Bezos was hand-packing books on the floor of his Seattle garage. Today, he’s operating a global powerhouse worth more than $1.5 trillion. Tomorrow, Amazon is poised to be the framework of our entire civilization - in fact, we’re already halfway there.\n\nFrom Alexa to self-flying drones, colossal fulfillment centres, and its very own airline, Amazon’s collection of high-tech innovation continues to grow. But as more and more money is funneled into the company, and as thousands more of us become reliant on its services every single day, before we know it, we’ll be living in cities completely run by Amazon.\n\nWould we be better or worse off for the technological revolution? Let’s see what an Amazon-run world would look like, and then you can decide that for yourself. \n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",
