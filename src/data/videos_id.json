        "description": "**  10/27/15 Farewell Tillman RIP  **  Tillman the skateboarding bulldog from the iphone commercial. All clips are from January 2007. Tillman was a little over a year old at the time. \nA little history of this first video. I Filmed the video using a just purchased Panasonic Lumix TZ1. I was bicycling through Venice Beach California when I came upon the skateboarding dog. Originally the first video had the soundtrack \"Giving In\" by linkin Park. Once the video appeared in iphone commercials I  removed the video from youtube because of the attention it was getting and I had no rights to use the song. As time approached for Apple's release of the iphone with youtube, youtube contacted me and requested I reinstate the video without the soundtrack. Youtube wanted users to be able to view the skateboarding dog in the store and after purchasing their iphone. Unfortunately youtube gave me only a few hours to re-edited video before the iphone release.  The original background sound on most of the clips was ruined by hysterical laughter from a woman watching Tillman so I cut and pasted sound in from other parts of the video to cover the laughter. That's why some claim they hear the word eskimo over and over-lol. When the original video with the Linkin Park soundtrack was selected it had around 15,000 views.",
